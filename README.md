# Food-Delivery-Management-System
# 1.Problem Analysis
The application should ressemble a food delivery management, where there are 3 types of 
users:admins, clients and employees. They should all perform specific operations like in real life for such 
an activity.
# 2.Modelling
The goal of the project is for the user to be able to manage a food delivery application with a login 
and register system. There are 3 types of users: Admin, Client and Employee. The admin can import menu 
items from a file, create new items (base products and composite products), edit items, delete items and 
generate reports. The client can order items, search for specific items using some filters and can generate 
bills. The employee receives a notification every time a new order is made

# Conclusions

This assignment offered me a good opportunity to remember and apply the object-oriented programming 
paradigms and concepts. It also offered us an insight into the process of designing and developing a software 
application.
Also, it was interesting as I had to learn how to serialize/ deserialize objects, how to create custom Javadoc 
tags, how to work with lambda expressions and streams and how to apply the Composite Design Pattern and the 
Observer Design Pattern, all these things in a homework that could be useful in real life.
What I will take with me from this experience is not to panic and try to stay calm and divide the problem into 
smaller ones that are easier to deal with, because otherwise the project can be quite overwhelming. Another thing 
is that testing frequently helps you avoid big errors on the long run.
I can say that I am proud that I managed to do this project on my own and that I found solutions for all the 
problems I had through intensive research.
The project is not perfect, it can still be improved, I could add more functionalities to the simulator, or design 
a friendlier and nicer GUI. The methods could also be improved as well as the organization and use of the classes.
